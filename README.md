Scientific question: Do temporal trajectories of human brain activities support visual decision-making?

Brief scientific background: Previous animal studies have shown that neural population responses fluctuate in a low-dimensional manifold and the temporal trajectories of population responses in this manifold contribute to decisional processes (Michaels, J. A., et al., 2015).

Proposed question: It remains unclear whether large-scale whole-brain activities also exhibit temporal trajectories that are linked to visual decision-making (Cunningham, J. P., & Yu, B. M., 2014).
